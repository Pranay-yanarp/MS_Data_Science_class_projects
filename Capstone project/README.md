# Capstone Project

## Summary
This repository contains Capstone Project for my Master's in Data Science. Our Project aim was to develop a method to detect different patterns in high resolution wood fossil images to classify damaged/undamaged part of the wood.

This repository does not contain the codes and data that I worked because the project was done under Prof. Chen Zeng (GWU) and he contains right to all the work. Hence I could only provide the Final reports of the work.
